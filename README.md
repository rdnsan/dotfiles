# Dotfiles

Hi! These are my dotfiles that I use every day. If you find something
interesting, go ahead and take whatever you want from my dotfiles.

It is managed using [yadm](https://github.com/TheLocehiliosan/yadm/), a dotfile
manager. This makes it simple to set up a new computer with these files. In
order to set up a new system with these dotfiles, do the following:

```sh
yadm clone git@github.com:rdnsan/dotfiles.git
```
